# Barter Sign
Application made to shop and sign documents with Solana.

## What is the problem?
Paying digitally while acquiring a product or a service poses a problem. One of the parties involved could be fraudulent. The solutions to these types of problems have traditionally involved centralized intermediaries. However, centralized intermediaries do not always act objectively. We provide a decentralized solution.

## Solution
The parties involved in the transaction create a case via Barter-Sign. The payment to be made is held on the site through Barter-Sign. The party sending the product uploads evidence of shipment to the system. The payment is held on the site until the goods are received. If there are no objections from either party, the payment is sent to the person who shipped the goods.

## If there is an objection...
The parties open an objection case, upload their documents, photos to the site, and explain their issues. Meanwhile, there is a **class of judges** on the site. They examine the case.
